# Perceptron Implementation

This project contains a Python implementation of the Perceptron algorithm, a fundamental algorithm for supervised learning in the field of Machine Learning. It includes a class definition for the Perceptron and a script for testing the implementation on a generated dataset that is linearly separable.

## About The Project

The Perceptron algorithm is a type of linear classifier, i.e., it attempts to classify given inputs into two distinct classes by finding a suitable linear boundary between them. The implementation provided in this project showcases the algorithm's ability to learn this boundary and make predictions on new data.

This project is structured into two main parts:

**Perceptron:** A Python class that encapsulates the Perceptron algorithm's learning process and prediction mechanism.
**generate_data:** A utility function for generating a synthetic, linearly separable dataset for testing the Perceptron.
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites
This project requires a Python environment (Python 3.6 or newer) and the installation of certain Python packages listed below:

numpy
matplotlib
### Installation
Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Perceptron-Project.git
Install Python packages

pip install numpy matplotlib
## Usage

To test the Perceptron implementation with the generated dataset, run the script from the command line:

python main_scriptt.py
This will generate a dataset, train the Perceptron model, and display a plot showing the classified points along with the decision boundary.
